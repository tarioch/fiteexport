A simple script to extract data from fitbit. Extracts all the tracked activities as tcx files and the daily stats in the same format as the web ui allows to extract for the last 30 days.
This can be used. e.g for importing into garmin connect.

Feel free to raise an issue if you want to use it and run into troubles.
